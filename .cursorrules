## Code Standards
- Clean, accurate, readable, and efficient code
- Comprehensive docstrings for all functions and classes
- Proper error handling and logging
- Type hints on all function parameters and return values
- Centralized API functionality rather than repeating across files
- Rate limiting and retries for all API requests
- Do not cut corners or leave updates for later.  If you start code, finish it.

## Implementation Rules
- DO NOT add unnecessary complexity or features not requested
- DO NOT over-engineer solutions; prefer simplicity
- Authentication should be discovered from OpenAPI spec when possible
- Only GET and POST requests are supported for API endpoints
- Proper documentation for all public APIs
- Proper unittests (with unittest) for all major functionality
